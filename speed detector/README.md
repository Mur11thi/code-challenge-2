#### By *Stephen Muriithi*

## Description
The above is a speed detector that checks the speed of moving vehicles on the road.It checks for whether
the speed limit is crossed by the vehicles and if so ,issues  demerit points based on how much one is beyond the speed limit.For every 5 Kilometers beyond the speed limit  a demerit point is added. 
The program also suspends  a driver's license when he has surpassed 12 demerit points, which is passed 125 kilometres per hour.This helps to reduce the number of accidents on the road and promote road safety.

It has been made possible by using  if statement and else if statements and also by using the > , < ,<= comparison operators and by also using arithmetic operators (-) and math.round as well.
